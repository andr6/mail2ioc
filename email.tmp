Subject: [RH-MP] Splunk: Single Instance small .exe over 24 hours

Hey All,

Sharing this and looking for other clever use cases on what could be looked
for. Set this to run back over 24 hours and look for <2mb exe that only
appear once in the logs - idea is that it should bubble up more targeted
attempts:

index="gis_bcoat" "GET" ".exe" cs_uri_path="*.exe" http_method="GET"
bytes_out<204800 NOT http_referrer="*" dest_host!="*.google.com"
dest_host!="gvt1.com"  | stats count values(cs_uri_path) by dest_host |
where count=1 | fields - count

It's FP prone, but quick to hunt from in the grand scheme of things!

Anyone got anything similar?
